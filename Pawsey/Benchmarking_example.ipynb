    "This notebook walks you through running a quantum circuit using several different common quantum computing frameworks: *PennyLane*, *Qiskit* and *CUDA-Q*. There are several others (e.g., *Cirq*, *Braket*), but we will focus on these three as they are popular and informative. These frameworks enable the noisy simulation of quantum circuits, though each has their own strengths and weaknesses. In this example, we will focus on the classical computational aspect of quantum computing simulation and how well different frameworks run and scale. \n",

    "## The Computational Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a real challenge in simulating quantum circuits. They require sufficient memory to store the possible combinations of qubit states and must perform many matrix-vector multiplications. A state-vector representation of a quantum circuit has a memory requirement that scales as $\\mathcal{O}(2^{n})$, where $n$ is the number of qubits. This challenge is even more significant for a full density-matrix representation, which is  often used as an approach to simulate a noisy quantum computing device, as it scales as $\\mathcal{O}(2^{2n})$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider running a full state-vector simulation with $n$-qubits and $m$ gates. Just the state vector requires $2\\times2^{n}$ floats (since we need to store complex numbers). To store in full, $m$ arbitrary unitaries for a $n$-qubit system requries $2m\\times2^{2n}$ floats and each gate is a matrix-vector operation, giving $\\approx m\\times2^{4n}$ floating point operations (for a nice discussion, see [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08880]).\n",

    "\\#. **State-vector simulators** can also be used to simulate noisy circuits to get an approximate result with the Monte Carlo method.  \n",
    "\\*. Circuits with N > 32 with the state-vector simulator should generally run on an HPC server.  \n",
    "\\+. Circuits with N > 16 with the density matrix simulator should generally run on an HPC server.       \n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, it becomes necessary to accelerate computation. However, not all quantum circuits demand a full state-vector simulation, and alternative methods—such as tensor network contractions, Stabilizer simulation and density matrix simulation —can significantly reduce computational complexity. In this work, we focus exclusively on performing full state-vector simulations across different frameworks and measuring the resulting time to solution to have a high-level overview. "

In Proceedings of the twenty-eighth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing (pp. 212-219).], Grover's algorithm is a canonical example of quantum speedup. It addresses the problem of unstructured search, identifying with high probability the unique input to a black-box function that produces a specified output. By reducing the number of required function evaluations to $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ represents the size of the function's domain, Grover’s algorithm offers a quadratic advantage over the classical approach, which necessitates $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ queries. Grover's algorithm revolutionized quantum computing by demonstrating a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, showcasing the power of quantum amplitude amplification."

By adjusting the slider, one can visualize how varying the phase difference between the target state and all other states affects the system’s evolution. Systematic exploration reveals that, at an optimal phase setting, the probability (and corresponding visual representation) of the target state becomes significantly larger than that of the other states. Notably, determining the maximal probability of success requires identifying not only the ideal phase shift but also the optimal measurement time, as both parameters jointly influence the outcome.\n"

    "A comparative analysis of *PennyLane*, *Qiskit*, and *CUDA-Q* in full state-vector simulations of Grover’s search with ideal qubits highlights how different frameworks impose practical constraints on quantum algorithm exploration. *PennyLane*, while offering a versatile set of features, can suffer from inefficient GPU resource utilization, leading to performance bottlenecks in large-scale simulations. *Qiskit*, on the other hand, encounters challenges related to unified memory access on the GH200 platform, introducing significant overhead costs that can limit scalability. In contrast, *CUDA-Q* , though more specialized and with fewer high-level capabilities, demonstrates superior efficiency in executing specific quantum algorithms. Its ability to leverage optimized memory management and GPU acceleration enables the simulation of larger qubit systems on a single node, making it particularly advantageous for high-performance quantum computing workloads.\n",
